                <p>My mother taught me to make this dressing when I was very young, and every time she made it, I helped. To this day it 
                    is my favorite thing to eat and cook! This is a treasured recipe in my family that has been passed down through multiple 
                    generations. I know some of these ingredients could turn some people off to the dish, but if you're feeling a little 
                    adventurous I urge you to give it a try and hopefully can learn to appreciate this recipe as much as I do.

            <li>1 head of romaine lettuce</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>1 can flat fillet anchovies (I prefer Cento)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. ground mustard</li>
            <li>1 single drop (seriously!) of Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 of a lemon</li>
            <li>1 raw egg yolk (If this makes you uncomfortable, here's a way to <a href="https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/how-to-pasteurize-eggs/">pasteurize</a>) </li>
            <li>~3 tbsp Oil (preferably something less flavored, like canola)</li>
            <li>Red Wine vinegar</li>
         </ul>
         <h5 id="directions">What to do</h5>
         <ol>
             <li>Chop, wash, and dry lettuce. Store lettuce in a large bowl lined with a clean dish towel, 
                wrap and cover lettuce, and put into fridge to chill.</li>
             <li> Press, grate, or <em>very</em> finely mince garlic into mortar then press/grind garlic 
                 with pestle for a few seconds.</li>
             <li>Remove anchovies from oil and discard any paticularily funky-looking ones. They should
                not smell overly fishy.<strong>Save the can <u>with</u> the oil for later!!</strong> Chop anchovies or break apart into medium-sized pieces with your hands
                and put into mortar with garlic. Press and grind again for a few seconds until mixture starts to form into a paste </li> 
             <li>Add dry mustard and press again until combined.</li>
             <li>Add Worcestershire and again, press.</li>
             <li>Make sure lemon is free of seeds before squeezing into mixture. This amount can be adjusted to taste—
                 I recommend starting with less and adding more at the end if you feel so inclined. Press until combined.
             </li>
             <li>Discard pestle—we'll be using a spoon to mix from here on out.
                 Seperate egg yolk from whites. I use the <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_separate_eggs/">eggshell</a> method.
                 Using spoon, stir yolk into mixture.</li>
             <li>Dump entirety of anchovy can oil into mixture and stir until combined.</li>
             <li>A good ratio for oil to vinegar is 3:1 respectively, however I find red wine vinegar can overpower easily
                 and I tend to halve the amount. Anyway, pour about 3 tablespoons of oil into mixture and stir until combined.
                 Sometimes, there will be seperation which is fine and normal, just stir until fully combined. If it's being stubborn, 
                 there may be a little too much oil so I'll add a little more of the dry mustard to help it bind easier.  
                 Your dressing should now look lumpy and a little thick, but not overly. 
             </li> 
             <li> You can store the dressing in the fridge in the mortar until you're ready to serve. To combine, simply pour
                 over lettuce and mix until evenly coated and it's ready!  </li>   
        </ol>
